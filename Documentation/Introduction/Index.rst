What does it do?
----------------

This extension provides an implementation of the Porto template for TYPO3.

For this extension to work you will have to [buy the theme from Themeforest](  https://themeforest.net/item/porto-responsive-html5-template/4106987?ref=zechendorf) and upload the unzipped files to ``fileadmin/Porto``.

The extension expects the HTML files to be in the folder ``fileadmin/Porto/HTML`` but this can be reconfigured in the template constants.

Template options can be configured in Constants.

To use the template:

* Install the extension
* Add (at least) the following static templates:
  * Fluid Content Elements (fluid_styled_content)
  * Fluid Content Elements CSS (fluid_styled_content)
  * porto - Template (porto)

Full documentation coming soon.
