This TYPO3 Extension aims to bring the Porto Theme from Okler to TYPO3.

For this extension to work you will have to [buy the theme from Themeforest](  https://themeforest.net/item/porto-responsive-html5-template/4106987?ref=zechendorf) and upload the unzipped files to ``fileadmin/Porto``.

The extension expects the HTML files to be in the folder ``fileadmin/Porto/HTML`` but this can be reconfigured in the template constants.

Template options can be configured in Constants.

Documentation coming soon.
