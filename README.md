![Porto Theme](Documentation/Images/porto-preview.png)

This TYPO3 Extension aims to bring the Porto Theme from Okler to TYPO3.

For this extension to work you will still have to [buy the theme from Themeforest](  https://themeforest.net/item/porto-responsive-html5-template/4106987?ref=zechendorf).

The extension expects the files to be in the folder ``fileadmin/Porto/HTML`` but this can be reconfigured in the template constants.

This extension is currently **work in progress** - do not expect it to do much.
