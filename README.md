PORTO
=====

This TYPO3 Extension aims to bring the Porto Theme from Okler to TYPO3.

For this extension to work you will still have to buy the theme from Themeforest:  
https://themeforest.net/item/porto-responsive-html5-template/4106987

The extension expects the files to be in the folder ``fileadmin/Porto/`` but this can be reconfigured in the template constants.

This extension is currently **work in progress**.
